William walked with determination across the desolate landscapes of Earth, desperately searching for his mother's necklace. The atmosphere was becoming increasingly toxic, and the heat was unbearable. Finally, he found the necklace amidst the rubble of what had once been his home. He took it with reverence and placed it around his neck, feeling a surge of nostalgia and sadness.

William (whispering): "Mother, you will always be with me."

While holding the necklace, William's mind dipped into a memory, recalling the happy days of his childhood with his brother Jack and his parents. However, he soon came back to the present, feeling the urgency to reunite with Jack and return to the SPACECRAFT.

William: "Jack must be worried about me. I must get back as soon as possible."

In the present, Jack was waiting in a SPACECRAFT, agitated, anticipating his brother's return. The ship was full of people, and the atmosphere was charged with tension.

Jack (to a crew member): "Any news of William? He's been gone too long!"

Crew member: "I'm sorry, Colonel. We haven't received any communication from him. We're losing time."

Jack, concerned, looked out the space window at the Earth fading into the horizon, as some ships departed for X2-H.

Jack: "Well, keep boarding people quickly!"

Despite the pressure and chaos on the ship, Jack decided to leave Earth, hoping that William could catch another ship in time. Time was pressing, and the fate of both brothers was at stake.

As Jack departed from Earth, the future of humanity on X2-H hung in the balance, and the union of the brothers would become the key to their survival in this new world. But how did they get to this critical point?

The story of William and Jack began in an advanced world, divided into six continents, where technology and survival were the main concerns. Both brothers faced a difficult childhood in an orphanage after the tragic death of their parents in a heartbreaking car accident. The emotional scars of those times never fully healed, and orphanhood forged them in a unique way.

William, with his sharp wit and warm heart, became an engineer specializing in space weapons, playing an essential role in ship management and defense against alien threats. He often wore a necklace that had belonged to his mother, an object of immense sentimental value that he always kept close to his heart. However, despite his intelligence and skills, William often felt marginalized by his colleagues and superiors, leading him to question his worth.

Jack, on the other hand, rose to the rank of colonel and led the team of ships, overseeing evacuation reports. He was a serious, introverted man, haunted by the emotional wounds that the loss of his parents and his orphanage experience had caused him. Despite his crucial role in the defense of humanity, Jack rarely showed his emotions and always seemed to be constantly preoccupied. He avoided spending time with his brother, although deep down he loved and cared deeply for him.

Humanity faced an imminent threat: the sun would become a red giant in the near future. NASA had received a warning in 2010 about this catastrophe, which led all nations to unite and reorganize into six continents, with the shared goal of evacuating Earth before it became uninhabitable.

With the collaboration of a Mexican scientist turned US citizen, mankind made rapid progress in space technology. This scientist developed a revolutionary warp drive that allowed space travel at speeds beyond imagination, making it an essential resource for the mission to find a new home.

After years of searching, humanity finally discovered a habitable planet called X2-H, although they did not know whether its inhabitants would be friend or foe. Humanity had only two trips available, and time was running out.

Finally, the day of departure arrived, and the ships began to take off with thousands of people on board, destined for a new world. However, amidst the confusion and rush, William was left behind on Earth. He couldn't board a ship. Jack's heart filled with anguish as he realized that his beloved brother had been left behind.

Despite his responsibility as the leader of the team of ships, he would have to make a decision: save his brother or lead the ships.

Soldier: I am sorry, Colonel... But we were ordered to save only you, as it would be dangerous to go looking for your brother under the circumstances.

Jack was desperate when he heard that, so much so that he started shouting that they had to go and rescue William.
Jack: What are they saying? Without him we wouldn't have his ideas about the ships and we would have died.
He shouted euphorically to the soldier, he also knew that, if he helped, he would save them, but rescuing him would be a suicide mission.
Soldier: I know, Colonel, but you yourself know it would be suicide. ...I understand that you are worried, but you can't always save a loved one in such a dangerous situation.
Jack was crying with rage, he would lose his brother, his family, he couldn't protect him all these years, he felt angry with himself, he collapsed, hitting the ground in fury.
Meanwhile, William stood at the place where the ships departed, hoping that someone, at least his brother, would save him, but that didn't seem to be the case. He hugged the pendant in his hands, saying.
William: Looks like we'll meet again, Mom, Dad. Jack, I always wanted to tell you what a great brother you were to me.
He said as he awaited his fate, looking up at the sky one last time with a tear welling up in his eyes.

Jack: Mr. Peter, have you seen if my brother boarded any of the ships?
Mr. Peter: That's impossible; we were just checking the numbers of crew members on the ships, and one was missing. We assume that's William, but I won't be able to...
Jack, upon hearing about William, quickly turned to head to the auxiliary ship room. He knew very well that they wouldn't let him go, but he made a decision, and it was to be with his only family.

"Where could he have gone?" wondered the captain. He left without any direction. He didn't know he couldn't have left. He opened the ship and headed to Earth; the guards were surprised and quickly communicated with the higher-ranking officers.

At that moment, his parents' house came to his mind. He took a truck and headed to the destination.

He arrived in despair, looked everywhere, his brother was not there, looked at his watch, there were twenty minutes left. Desperate, he began to run around without losing hope when he saw hair just like his brother's and simply ran to grab him by the wrist. When he turned around.

William (surprised): Brother? What are you doing here?
He sighed happily, but the sound of the device on his wrist began to ring. There were only ten minutes left to pull his brother back.
Jack: Why did you leave the ship?
Jack didn't hear any answer, but as he turned around, his eyes went to the necklace on his neck, and he understood.
When they returned to the ship, they started the route to the new planet.
In another part of space:
The captains couldn't believe it; they were in the middle of a war with the inhabitants of that planet. They were being outnumbered and overpowered.
They tried to make a retreat, but these inhabitants didn't make it easy; they seemed enraged by our presence.
They had to warn the incoming ships not to approach this planet. It was dangerous.
But it was too late...

Jack knew he had to do everything possible to rescue William before Earth became uninhabitable. But upon reaching the planet, they didn't know if the beings living there would allow them to stay.

While Jack was still heading to planet Earth to rescue William, the other ships arrived at planet X2-H. Upon landing, they were surrounded by the planet's inhabitants. These beings had a strange appearance; from the waist down, their legs were replaced by crustacean legs, totaling four; from the waist up to their neck, they had a kind of blue and violet armor. On their faces, they had four eyes along with a kind of tentacle behind their ears. A few minutes later, the general of that squadron showed up, shouting at them to get off the ship; he spoke a language similar to English. In one of the ships, he opened the doors. Ten people descended through the hatch: five soldiers, three NASA scientists, and two presidents from the continents of Europe and America. When they stood in front of the general, he asked them why they landed on his planet without authorization.

The president of America began to explain the situation, that the sun would become a red giant and the fate of Earth. Upon hearing this, the general told them that they would go to see the leader of the planet to talk to him, while the rest of the people would stay inside the ships, watched by his soldiers from the outside, as they headed to the leader's house through the city. Primarily, they marveled at the structures. When they arrived at the leader's residence, they saw that it was a large building with a futuristic design.

Upon entering, they found him seated on a kind of throne. When they were in front of him, the general explained the situation. The presidents began to propose some deals so that they could live on the planet. After hours, the king agreed that they could live on this planet, with some restrictions. In the end, the ten, along with the general, went to the ships to notify the people. When they arrived and gave the news, people began to shout with happiness at being able to survive; with presidents and soldiers, it was no different, until a colonel asked: "What will we do with Colonel Jack and his brother William?"

Meanwhile, Jack continued traveling to search for his brother, but there was a significant problem: the ship had some faults that could cause it to stop at any moment. He prayed that he would at least have time to reach Earth and reunite with his brother, but fate had other plans, as the ship stopped working immediately. Jack cursed for this; he couldn't come to rescue William, he couldn't protect him. Their relationship became distant; now, he could only cry for not being able to see him again. However, suddenly, five ships approached his sides. Through the scanner, he could see some soldiers inside them along with an extraterrestrial being. Then he claimed that they could make a deal to be able to live on the planet.

Jack opened a hatch so that two ships could enter and rescue him. When he got off, a soldier approached him to explain what happened, receiving the affirmation that they can live on planet X2-H. Jack was happy about this until he asked.

Jack (anxious): "But what about William? Can we go rescue him, right?"
Jack asked anxiously, awaiting the response, hoping it would be what he wanted to hear.

Jack felt a premonition that something was wrong, but he simply stared at the tablet containing the instructions from the sergeant major; the instructions were simple, he had to head directly to the new planet. Leaving the planet was not easy for Jack; after all, it was the home of every human being, and he was concerned that William might be on a ship.

He took a slight breath and stood up from his seat; he was the one giving instructions to everyone, he was the captain. With a mission that involved leaving and never returning home.

The premonition followed him as if a knife were stuck in his heart; he was loyal to premonitions, so he only managed to look around. When he saw a group of crew members saying something to the guards at the entrance that separated all the handling of the ship, he tried to approach when a woman approached him, saying they had everything in order. He nodded and returned to his place.

When he saw one of William's colleagues approaching, he hoped they knew something about William.

Jack: Mr. Peter, do you know anything about my brother?
Mr. Peter: Greetings, Colonel. Unfortunately, I don't know where he is, but we suspect he might have been the man who left, but they didn't wait for him.
They had already passed Earth's atmosphere and were far enough away when a soldier approached Jack, shouting so loudly that it sent chills down his spine upon hearing what he said.
Soldier: Colonel, the man who left is your brother. They didn't wait for him!

Jack couldn't maintain his balance and collapsed to the floor. He couldn't believe it; he didn't know exactly if it was his brother or not, but something told him it was.

He got up so abruptly to head towards the back of the ship and start looking for a ship. He asked for help from the higher-ups, but they didn't listen. When a woman approached with a tablet showing the cameras that could be seen from Earth, he saw his brother; he could see him desperate to get out of there, waiting for someone to come. He didn't understand why his brother left.

When he received the news that he could go look for him with the ship, the force of an explosion was seen through the large window. Earth had disappeared along with his brother, the only family he had left.

In another part of space:

The captains couldn't believe it; the inhabitants of that planet were fighting against them, wanting to remove them from their planet. Thus, a war began, in which the inhabitants were winning. The humans were outnumbered and overpowered. The sergeant immediately asked to leave those lands to give the order to retreat to all the soldiers. He also asked to tell the ships carrying the remaining humans not to approach that planet. They had to go back to look for another planet for humans with the same characteristics as Earth, their homeland.

Soldier: Yes, Colonel, we received the order to save both you and your brother. You helped us a lot through your work in the militia, and without your brother, we couldn't have created this.

Jack cried with happiness because he could save his brother and be by his side again. Without wasting time, they boarded the ship and went to rescue him. Meanwhile, William was waiting in the same place where the ships took off, hoping that someone, at least his brother, would go look for him, but that didn't seem to be the case. He sat hugging his necklace, waiting for the end while saying, "Apparently, we will meet again with mom and dad." But he saw how a ship different from the others landed a few meters from him, fixing his gaze he could see how someone came down from it shouting his name, then he could recognize his voice; it was his brother who came to rescue him. He ran, and when he arrived, he hugged him with all his strength, crying along with Jack.
